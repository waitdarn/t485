                        work that you have already started or possibly completed.</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise specified, work for a requirement can be started at any time. Ask your counselor to help you learn the things you need to know or do. You should obtain and read the merit badge pamphlet on the subject.</p>

                        The counselor will test you on each requirement to make sure you know your stuff and have done or can do the things required.</p>

                    <p>The current Boy Scout Requirements book is available from your local Scouting merchandise distributor. It may also be ordered online at www.scoutstuff.org. Merit badge requirements are revised as needed to reflect updated information and
                        technology. Click here to view new and recently revised merit badges.</p>
                    <p>You are expected to meet the requirements as they are stated—no more and no less. You must do exactly what is stated in the requirements. If it says "show or demonstrate," that is what you must do. Just telling about it isn’t enough. The
                        same thing holds true for such words as "make", "list", "in the field", and "collect", "identify", and "label."</p>
